Hello, this is my first blog built with (Jekyll)[https://jekyllrb.com/] and hosted on (Github Pages)[https://pages.github.com/]. The main reason I wanted to start writing is to simply practice. It is very important to be able to articulate and express my thoughts with words in order for the audience to understand my perspective and ideas. So it is very likely that the next few blog posts on my page will be very poorly written, unresourceful, unintelligent, and unreasonable. In fact I will probably read this exact post the day after it was posted and wince at the quality of my own writing. I hope to make daily posts and write everyday, sort of like a journal. Most posts being nice and short, I think this won't be a bad idea. I will update the layout and the look of my site as time goes on, add some neat animations and graphics here and there. At the end of the day I'll be a bit more preoccupied and experienced.
