I've read the past two blogs and I realized how much of a terrible mistake it was to not review and edit the posts after writing them. I'll let them be as a reminder to always double check my work. Right now the conventions for naming these blog posts are by their ascending order since there isn't a meaningful topic to write about. They're are just entries into a journal which, no one will likely read and that's just fine with me. Today I was more productive, I slept for 7 hours and felt refreshed in the morning and started programming when I woke up. I currently practice Ruby on [Coderbyte](http://wwww.coderbyte.com), I would solve two or more challenges each day, and while solving the challenges I would always be referencing, [Ruby docs](http://www.ruby-doc.org/), [Stack Overflow](http://www.stackoverflow.com/), and my favourite comparing my code to other users code. It's marvellous to see so many different ways of approaching a problem and the different methods and objects used to solve these problems. I believe this is a spectacular way to get familiar with any programming language as you'll always be learning new methods and techniques to solve challenges. Coderbyte has given me incentive and a fun way of practicing programming, and it's incredible how much more I know compared to the previous day. It's also pretty remarkable that I've barely scratched the surface of programming with Ruby and building web applications, but I sincerely believe I'm making good progress as I am getting more productive and learning how to practice more effectively.
