title: Few Will Read This and That's OK
---

There are millions of personal blogs so why should I make one? I would say that this blog is geared more towards myself rather than an actual audience. A good enough reason for me to build this website is so that I can try and make daily incremental changes to the design and function of the blog. This will help me to learn more about Jekyll and add some neat styling and interactions. Also it will give me a moment to reflect upon my work, blog posts, and the progress I am making each day.  Sort of like a journal but less personal, less frequent in entries, and accessible by the public. It'll certainly be nice if anyone that stumbles onto this blog can get something out of my writing. If not then that's cool.

The greatest benefit that I see to building and writing on this thing is that it will greatly improve my English and writing skills. I might as well practice some markdown while I'm here.
Here's a list of books that I plan to read:

- Programming Ruby 1.9 & 2.0 (Pickaxe)
- Practical Object-Oriented Design in Ruby
- The Pragmatic Programmer: From Journeyman to Master
- Confident Ruby
- Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Code
- The Mythical Man-Month: Essays on Software Engineering
