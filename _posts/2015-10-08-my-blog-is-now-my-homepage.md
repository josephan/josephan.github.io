title: My Blog Is Now My Homepage
---

I decided that my blog/website will be my home page so that I will make daily incremental changes to the design and function of the blog to learn more about Jekyll and add some neat styling and interactions. Also it will give me a moment to reflect upon my work, blog posts, and the progress I am making each day. I would say that this blog is geared more towards myself rather than an actual audience. Sort of like a journal but less personal, less frequent in entries, and accessible by the public. It'll certainly be nice if anyone that stumbles onto this blog can get something out of my writing. If not then at least I can improve my writing and communication skills and hopefully in the future I can write something worthwhile of other people's time.
