title: One Random Thing Per Week
---

One of the main reason I moved out to downtown Toronto was to slash the time spent each day commuting. I was able to save an hour and a half each day and I would use the extra time to try to become extremely productive. I wanted to become a skilled developer, physically active, fluent in Korean, good at playing the piano, and read more books. But it felt like a waste of time spending most of your time to try and fit in as much activities as possible. It basically felt like multi-tasking for the long term. If I were to put in that amount of focus and energy on any given day, it would be more efficient and meaningful if it were to be spent on a single goal or mission.

The best analogy I can think of is that I felt like Squidward when he moved into a utopian like neighborhood and started to become bored and adjusted of his new life. And deep down I kind of missed my parents just like how he missed Spongebob and Patrick. So from now on the plan is to do at least one random thing per week. The purpose of this is to enjoy life more.

I am going to go to the local library and get training and certification to use the 3D printer. I will then print a 3D bust of Beethoven.
