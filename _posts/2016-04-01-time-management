Time is the most valuable resource a person can have in the world. At the time this post was written, no amount of wealth or resources can make a person live forever. Time is the god of leveling the playing field.

There's always little areas throughout the day where you can save time:
* do not oversleep
* take the time to learn tools that will make you more efficient
* use a to-do list to finish the important things first (as this becomes a habit you won't have to write anything down)
* cut down the duration of commute
* temporarily block sites that are distracting
