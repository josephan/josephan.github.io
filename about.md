Hi, my name is Joseph and I'm a software developer in Toronto. Right now I work at [FundThrough](https://www.fundthrough.com/){:target="_blank"} as a Ruby on Rails developer.

When I'm not at work, I like reading books, practicing programming, practicing the piano, and listening to classical music.

My long term goals are: being a good [programmer](https://www.github.com/josephan/){:target="_blank"} and [piano player](./../recordings/){:target="_blank"}.
