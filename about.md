Hi, my name is Joseph and I'm a software developer in Toronto.

Right now I work at [FundThrough](https://www.fundthrough.com/){:target="_blank"} as a Ruby on Rails developer. FundThrough’s mission is to help small businesses in Canada by providing them a line of credit for their invoices and contracts. Basically this means that if you’re a small business that sells goods or services to larger and more established businesses, it is very likely that your invoices do not get paid for up to 30, 60, or 90 days. Many small businesses around the world deal with this issue and go under because they do not have enough cash flow to either expand, pay employees, manufacture goods, etc. We believe in what we do because supporting small businesses and entrepreneurs helps improve people’s lives by creating jobs and strengthening the economy.

When I'm not at work, I like reading books, practicing programming, practicing the piano, and listening to classical music.

My long term goals are: being a good [programmer](https://www.github.com/josephan/){:target="_blank"} and [piano player](./../recordings/){:target="_blank"}.
