Hello my name is Joseph An and I'm a web developer in Toronto. I mainly work with Ruby on Rails and JavaScript. In the future I look forward to learning newer technologies such as Go or older ones like C++. Also I look forward to reading more books and become a better programmer. I want to create useful things for people for the rest of my life because many others have created things that made my life worth living and I don't want to waste this chance. Send me an email anytime.
